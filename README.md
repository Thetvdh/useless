Useless is a repo for my useless code that I write for fun.

## Bogosearch
- My spin on the infamous bogosort algorithm. It takes a number from the command line and finds it in an array
by randomly checking an array value and seeing if it is the chosen array. What makes my implementation even better is that if the
search value isn't in the array it will never end.

## Bubble bogosort
- Implementation of a bubble sort algorithm but with a twist. A random index is selected and then compared to the item next to it. It then swaps them if the index chosen is bigger than the index+1. This is repeated until the list is sorted.
